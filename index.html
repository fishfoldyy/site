      <h1>my site</h1>
      <p>hey guys, this is my SIL project: a html/js/css website! </p>
    </div>
    <div id="about" style="padding: 10px;">
      <h4>what is html/js/css?</h4>
      <p>html/js/css are different types of files. basically, html files tell you the layout of a website and the contents of the website. js (javascript) files give you logic of the website, for example, what a button should do. css files tell the website what the text or buttons should look like, which is why this website looks good at all. when combined together, they make a nice webpage.</p>
      <h4>what can you do with this?</h4>
      <p>well, html is used on 94.5% of all websites, css is used on 96.9%, and javascript is used on 97.9% of all websites. basically everything you see on the internet is built on html/js/css, from simple text sites to search engines to multiplayer games. you can basically do anything you can put on a website.</p>
      <h4>how hard was it to make this?</h4>
      <p>most of the "complex" part of this is the javascript portion. but otherwise, its actually pretty simple. the html coding is pretty intuitive and simple. i just type this text out in the file and boom! it appears on my site. the css styling is also fairly simple. its pretty intuitive too, and its very easy to make your site look good.</p>
