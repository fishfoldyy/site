        Katamino is a puzzle game in which the player is given a board of a certain
        size and a set of pieces to fill that board. Each piece is unique in shape
        but consists of 5 square "blocks", meaning all pieces have the same area.
        When it comes to the board, even though the height of the board is a
        constant 5 blocks, its width depends on the number of pieces selected;
        for each piece selected, the board gets one block added to its width. Thus,
        the board always has just enough space to accomodate all the pieces selected
        - the challenge is to make them all fit!

        <br><br>
        Select 'Find only one solution' to reduce calculating time.
